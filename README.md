1]Building Fernwicks tree


2]Given an expression string exp, write a program to examine whether the pairs and the orders of “{“,”}”,”(“,”)”,”[“,”]” are correct in exp. For example, the program should print true for exp = “[()]{}{[()()]()}” and false for exp = “[(])”

3]Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the least common ancestor.

4]Remove duplicate elements from an unsorted array of size N

5]Given a dictionary that contains mapping of employee and his manager as a number of (employee, manager) pairs like below.
{ "A", "C" },
{ "B", "C" },
{ "C", "F" },
{ "D", "E" },
{ "E", "F" },
{ "F", "F" } 

In this example C is manager of A, 
C is also manager of B, F is manager 
of C and so on,employee can report to himself too
Output should be a Dictionary that contains following.
A - 0  
B - 0
C - 2
D - 0
E - 1
F - 5 

5]Given an out of order list of boarding passes with src -> dest, print out the itinerary.
input: [LAX -> SFO, DCA -> LAX, SEA -> DCA, SFO -> JFK]
output: SEA -> DCA -> LAX -> SFO -> JFK

6]Search,Insert,delete a string in a dictionary.

7]Given two binary trees, check if the first tree is subtree of the second one. A subtree of a tree T is a tree S consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T. The subtree corresponding to the root node is the entire tree; the subtree corresponding to any other node is called a proper subtree.
